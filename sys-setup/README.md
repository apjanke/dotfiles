System Setup Scripts
========================

These are my scripts for setting up new computers and user accounts.

For the most part, these scripts are idempotent, so you can run them repeatedly on the same system or user.

This is all "alpha" quality, for personal use. All of it, including any interface or implementation, is subject to change at any time.

The OS X scripts are largely based on Mathias Bynens' dotfiles (https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).
