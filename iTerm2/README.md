#  README - iTerm prefs  #

This is for iTerm prefs to be shared between computers.

They're not fully portable because of hardware differences. So I've broken this up in to subdirectories where each subdir is a class of machines that can share a file well. The main difference is display DPI: regular and old pre-retina "hi-res" laptops need different font sizes to be legible. (Retina and plain non-retina might need different ones, too; dunno because I don't have a low-res non-retina at this point.)  So "retina" and "hi-res" are the machine classes for now.
