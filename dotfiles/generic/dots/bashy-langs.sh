# Ruby Environment

# Ruby needs a few things:
#   * Add Gems bin to path.
#   * Set Gems GEM_* env vars (for gem install locations).
#   * Load RVM.
#   * Maybe others?

# TODO: Figure out a better way to handle this Ruby versioning stuff!
# I am currently using Ruby on both Mac and Linux. On Mac, I install it with
# either MacPorts or Homebrew. On Linux, I use the distro Ruby/bundler packages.
# (I don't really know how Ruby Gems path management is supposed to work.)
# (Maybe I should be using rvm instead?)
#
# Besides the stuff here, there's also MacPorts-managed Ruby/gem/bundler, but that
# should be handled by the MacPorts path management stuff. I think.

# Set GEM_* variables so it defaults to user instead of system installs, which is needed
# for systems with locked-down permissions, like MacPorts-managed macOS and some Linux
# setups. And I want to default to user-scoped Gem installs anyway.
#
# TODO: Also, you're not supposed to set GEM_HOME or GEM_PATH manually when using RVM.
# Dunno if the later call to RVM will override the.

# if [[ -z $GEM_HOME ]]; then
#   if [[ -d "$HOME/.gem" ]]; then
#     export GEM_HOME="$HOME/.gem"
#     # TODO: Is this actually necessary?
#     export GEM_PATH="${HOME}/.gem"
#   fi
# fi

# This is disabled because as of 2023-01-17 I think it's wrong; it sticks the
# version-specific system-managed Gem stuff on the path ahead of the MacPorts unversioned
# stuff, or something like that? -apj
